# Light_Up_Solver

 --- 28th October 2024 ---
 
This is a personal project for a first-class achiever in a BSc in data science and analytics looking to apply AI to make processes more efficient.

The idea of this project can be divided into three parts:
 ### Image recognition and classification
   The goal is to utilize image recognition techniques to process an image and create an nxn matrix of "cell" objects.
   Each cell will represent a specific classification based on visual features detected from the image.
   The class will have defined attributes, and a method will be designed to define attributes like: "lit", "number", or "solid".
   
 ### Find the solution
   With the environment established through image recognition and classification, the next step is to design an algorithm to find a solution within the defined matrix.
   Trying classic algorithms like BFS and DFS.
   Use reinforcement learning.
   
 ### Implementation
   The next step is to create a web-based application where an agent can visualize and implement the solution dynamically.
